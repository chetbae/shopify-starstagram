# [shopify-starstagram](http://shopify-starstagram.herokuapp.com/)

## Why
This web application is my submission to <b>Shopify's</b> [Frontend Intern Summer 2022 Challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13zXpyrC2yGxoLXKktxw2VJG2Jw8SdUfliLM-bYQLjqE/edit#). Look to the stars with NASA's Astronmy Picture Of the Data API! Presented in a scrolling web application to peruse NASA's extensive media library.


## Implementation

### Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`
Runs the react app in the development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

- `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

- `npm build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### Sources

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- Architected with Typescript, React, StyledComponents.

## Improvements

### Accessability
With a Google Lighthouse accessability score of 75, improvements can be made to the application user interface to address accessability concerns.

### Functionality
Due to a time constraint, a saved photos page was left out. Though, the running site logs likes into the localStorage of the browser so the user's actions persists through different sessions. Next, a page could be made to display all of the user's liked astronomical photos.
